*This section is still under construction and will be updated soon.* Meanwhile you can look at some usage example in
the [start page](Scaldi.html).

If you want to get some more examples, I can also recommend you to look at the test classes:

If you want to use *Scaldi* in your project, please look at [Project Setup](Project+Setup.html) page.
