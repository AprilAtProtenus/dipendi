# Scaldi

*Scaldi* -- is Scala dependency injection library. Basically Scala
already have everything you need for dependency injection. But still some things can be made easier.
Goal of the project is to provide more standard and easy way to make dependency injection in Scala
projects consuming power of the Scala language. With *Scaldi* you can define your application modules in pure Scala
without any annotations or XML.

## Getting a Taste of Scaldi

```scala
class AppModule extends Module {
  bind [Printer] to new StreamPrinter
  bind [PrintStream] to Console.out
}

class ConfigModule extends Module {
  binding identifiedBy "userName" to "Bob"
  binding identifiedBy "prefix" and "console" to "Howdy, "
}

object MyApp extends App with Injectable {
  implicit val modules = new AppModule :: new ConfigModule

  val printer = inject [Printer]

  printer print "Welcome!"
}

trait Printer {
  def print(str: String): Unit
}

class StreamPrinter(implicit inj: Injector) extends Printer with Injectable {
  val userName = inject [String] (identified by "userName" and by default "Anonimous")
  val prefix = inject [String] ("console" and "prefix" and by default "Hello, ")
  val writer = inject [PrintStream] (by default Console.err)

  def print(str: String) {
    writer.println(prefix + userName + " - " + str)
  }
}
```

I demonstrated you one of many *Scaldi* flavours. If something bothers you in this example,
don't be afraid, *Scaldi* has also many other flavours that can match your taste.

For example, you can define you bindings by defining `val`s and `def`s. So example above can also be written as:

```scala
class AppModule extends Module {
  lazy val printer: Printer = new StreamPrinter
  lazy val consoleStream: PrintStream = Console.out
}

class ConfigModule extends Module {
  val userName = "Bob"

  binding identifiedBy "prefix" and "console" to "Howdy, "
}
```

You can even avoid dependency on `Injector` in your own classes, if you like:

```scala
class AppModule extends Module {
  bind [Printer] to StreamPrinter(
    userName = inject (identified by "userName" and by default "Anonimous"),
    prefix = inject ("console" and "prefix" and by default "Hello, "),
    writer = inject (by default Console.err)
  )

  bind [PrintStream] to Console.out
}

// ...

case class StreamPrinter(userName: String, prefix : String, writer:PrintStream) extends Printer {
  def print(str: String) {
    writer.println(prefix + userName + " - " + str)
  }
}
```

## Features

Among many useful features of *Scaldi*, I would like to highlight most important ones:

* 100% scala for binding definition and usage
* Advanced compile-time and run-time module composition
* You are given choice to decide how you want to make dependency injection:
    * If you want to stay on the safe side, you can use side-effect free `StaticModule` which can contribute it's own
      bindings to the module composition, but can't consume other bindings from the composition
    * Or you can use `Module` which has some side effect during initialization process, but can also consume all
    other bindings from the module composition
* Ability to define your bindings in number of ways
    * with expressive and type-safe Scala DSL:

            bind [Server] as 'http to new HttpServer

    * as members of a class or trait:

            lazy val http: Server = new HttpServer

    * in properties file (for the simple bindings)
    * create your own - it's easy!
* Expressive and type-safe injection Scala DSL:
        inject [Server] (identified by 'http and by default new HttpServer)
* Conditional bindings
* Laziness by default
* Highly extensible - you can generally customize any aspect of the library like identifiers, conditions, modules, etc.
