# Scaldi

*Scaldi* -- is Scala dependency injection library. Scala
already has everything you need for dependency injection but some things could be easier.
The goal of *Scaldi* is to provide a more standard and easy way to handle dependency injection in Scala
projects, enhancing the power of the Scala language. With *Scaldi* you can define your application modules in pure Scala
without any annotations or XML.

## Getting a Taste of Scaldi

```scala
class AppModule extends Module {
  bind [Printer] to new StreamPrinter
  bind [PrintStream] to Console.out
}

class ConfigModule extends Module {
  binding identifiedBy "userName" to "Bob"
  binding identifiedBy "prefix" and "console" to "Howdy, "
}

object MyApp extends App with Injectable {
  implicit val modules = new AppModule :: new ConfigModule

  val printer = inject [Printer]

  printer print "Welcome!"
}

trait Printer {
  def print(str: String): Unit
}

class StreamPrinter(implicit inj: Injector) extends Printer with Injectable {
  val userName = inject [String] (identified by "userName" and by default "Anonimous")
  val prefix = inject [String] ("console" and "prefix" and by default "Hello, ")
  val writer = inject [PrintStream] (by default Console.err)

  def print(str: String) {
    writer.println(prefix + userName + " - " + str)
  }
}
```

This demonstrates one of the many *Scaldi* flavours. If something bothers you in this example,
don't worry, *Scaldi* has also many other flavours that can match your taste.

For example, you can define bindings using `val`s and `def`s. So the example above can also be written as:

```scala
class AppModule extends Module {
  lazy val printer: Printer = new StreamPrinter
  lazy val consoleStream: PrintStream = Console.out
}

class ConfigModule extends Module {
  val userName = "Bob"

  binding identifiedBy "prefix" and "console" to "Howdy, "
}
```

You can even avoid the dependency on `Injector` in your own classes, if you like:

```scala
class AppModule extends Module {
  bind [Printer] to StreamPrinter(
    userName = inject (identified by "userName" and by default "Anonimous"),
    prefix = inject ("console" and "prefix" and by default "Hello, "),
    writer = inject (by default Console.err)
  )

  bind [PrintStream] to Console.out
}

// ...

case class StreamPrinter(userName: String, prefix : String, writer:PrintStream) extends Printer {
  def print(str: String) {
    writer.println(prefix + userName + " - " + str)
  }
}
```

## Features

Some *Scaldi* features include:

* 100% scala for binding definition and injection
* Advanced compile-time and run-time module composition
* Flexibile interface:
    * If you want to stay on the safe side, you can use the side-effect free `StaticModule` which can contribute it's own
      bindings to the module composition, but can't consume other bindings
    * Or you can use `Module` which has some side effect during the initialization process, but can also consume all
    other bindings from the module composition
* Ability to define your bindings in a number of ways
    * with expressive and type-safe Scala DSL:

            bind [Server] as 'http to new HttpServer

    * as members of a class or trait:

            lazy val http: Server = new HttpServer

    * in properties file (for the simple bindings)
    * create your own - it's easy!
* Expressive and type-safe injection Scala DSL:
        inject [Server] (identified by 'http and by default new HttpServer)
* Conditional bindings
* Laziness by default
* Highly extensible - you can generally customize any aspect of the library like identifiers, conditions, modules, etc.
