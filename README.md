[Scaldi](http://scaldi.org) provides simple and elegant way to do dependency injection in Scala. By using expressive power of the Scala language
      it defines intuitive and idiomatic DSL for binding and injecting dependencies. It is very extensible library, so you can easily extend or customise
      almost any aspect of it. Some of the more unique Scaldi features are advanced module composition and conditional bindings which definitely will
      help you build all kinds of applications - from small command-line tools to big non-trivial web applications. Not to mention Scaldi also nicely integrates with Akka and Play.
